Game of life showcases/examples in various languages.

# Short story
A long time ago, when I was learning to code, one the first complete piece of software I made was a C++ command line Game of Life. 

I was very proud of it, of being able to finish something: I was a programmer. I lost that original code, but always had an interest in writing the Game of Life in different programming languages and comparing them.
